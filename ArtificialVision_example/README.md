    Given an input image and a set of predefined categories, the developed computer vision system classify 
    the input image into the right category. 
    The program uses SIFT/SURF descriptors, uses k-means algorythm to classify the images of training, creates
    BoVW iamge descriptors of each image and produces a k-nn classifier.
